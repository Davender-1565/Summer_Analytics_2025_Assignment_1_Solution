# 📊 Summer Analytics 2025 — Assignment 1

Welcome to my submission for the first assignment of **Summer Analytics 2025**, organized by the Analytics Club. This task involved working with a dataset (`Cars.csv`) using Python and performing various data analysis operations using Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib/Seaborn.

## 📁 Files Included

- `Assignment_Solution.ipynb` — Jupyter Notebook containing all the answers, visualizations, and code explanations.
- `Cars.csv` — The dataset used throughout the assignment.

## 🧠 Topics Covered

This assignment tested and improved skills in the following areas:

- Data cleaning and handling missing values
- Grouping and aggregation using `groupby`
- Calculating statistics like mean, median, standard deviation
- Filtering data based on conditions
- Creating meaningful visualizations using:
  - `matplotlib`
  - `seaborn`
- Logical reasoning using real-world datasets

## ✅ Key Highlights

- Identified patterns in car fuel efficiency (`mpg`) over time across different origins.
- Found models with the best horsepower-to-weight ratio.
- Defined and filtered "consistent" car models based on low variation in mileage.
- Built multiple visualizations to support and explore analytical insights.

## 🔗 How to Run

1. Open `Assignment_Solution.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook.
2. Ensure `Cars.csv` is in the same directory.
3. Run the cells sequentially.

## 📌 Note

Some parts of the task required additional Python research and documentation reading — this was helpful in understanding real-world applications of Pandas and data exploration.
